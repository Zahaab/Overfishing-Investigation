    " # An investigation into the identification of vulnerable fish species due to overfishing in Europe using matrix mdoles\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfishing is the capturing of fish from a body of water at a rate that the species cannot replenish in time, resulting in those species either becoming depleted or very underpopulated in that given area. The rate that a species replenishes can be modeled in a number of ways, this report uses leslie matrix models for 14 species that are well documented in scientific data and determines how vulnerable their populations are due to the direct effects of overfishing or the pollution that overfishing brings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following species traits and characteristics can be used to determine population vulnerability due to the pollution in an environment: (1) susceptibility to exposure of toxins, (2) toxicological sensitivity and (3) population sustainability [1],[2]. This investigation focuses on (3) however due to the nature of the data being considered (fertility rates and survival rates) (1) and (2) have been accounted for and will rightly have affected the outcome of this report. Such as the finding that European perch's (Perca fluviatilis) status should be changed on The IUCN RED LIST OF THREATENED SPECIES, it's current status is \"Least Concern\" and was last evaluated in 2008[3]. It should be noted that the susceptibility of fish exposure to pesticides of the species I am investigating has been assessed in two studies[4],[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Fertility and mortality rates, are the two main life-cycle traits which determine how populations propagate. Impacts on fertility and mortality rates, whether natural (such as weather conditions) or manmade (such as the introduction of positive toxins or pesticides), cannot be linearly or consistently related to the dynamics of populations since different rates contribute differently to population growth [6]. This being said the effects of individual impacts on life-cycle traits go beyond the scope of this investigation and is the place for further study, however this investigation does work with real world fertility and mortality rates.

    "## 2. Materials and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The data in use\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data I have gathered has been provided in a folder named \"Project3\". Within that folder there are files that begin with \"CL_FI\",\"DSD_FI\" and \"TS_FI\", \"CL_FI\" files are used to understand the data that is in \"TS_FI\", \"TS_FI\" contains all the global capture data from 1950 till 2016 in a csv file and was taken from FAO[7]. The last files in \"Project3\" are \"Moddle_SPECIES_GROUPS.csv\"; holds the names and codes of the species of fish, \"SPECIES_FERTILITY_RATE.csv\" and \"SPECIES_SURVIVAL_RATE.csv\", the fertility and survival rates of the 14 species that are being investigated and is gathered from many sources: Perca fluviatilis[8], Barbatula barbatula[9], Lota lota[10], Gasterosteus aculeatus[11], Pungitius pungitius[11], Esox lucius[12], Tinca tinca[13], Scardinius erythrophthalmus[14], Rutilus rutilus[14], Rhodeus amarus[15], Leucaspius delineatus[16], Carassius carassius[17], Barbus meridionalis[18], Leuciscus leuciscus[19].\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used to find fertility and survival rate of which the data in \"Gathered_data\" uses takes into account, Ecological risk assessment (ERA), this mainly relies on standard toxicity tests which deliver endpoints regarding the survival, growth and reproduction of test individuals [20].\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The model species\n",
    "\n",
    "The 14 model species were chosen for the following traits, native to Europe and there is sufficient data was available. There are a few unintended patterns that have occured in the selection, all the model species are short distance migrators which reproduce in freshwater and highly susceptible to pesticide exposure[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Software and model design\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leslie matrix is used in ecology to model the changes in a population of organisms over a period of time. In a Leslie model, the population is divided into groups based on age classes. The Leslie matrix is a square matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the population vector has elements. The (i,j)th cell in the matrix indicates how many individuals will be in the age class i at the next time step for each individual in stage j. The population is represented by a vector with an element for each age class where each element indicates the number of individuals currently in that class. At each time step, the population vector is multiplied by the Leslie matrix to generate the population vector for the subsequent time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long term prognosis of the population can be described by the eigenvalue of the leslie matrix that has the greatest magnitude. If it's magnitude is greater than 1, there will be exponential growth, but if it is less than one then this will become exponential decay. The dominant eigenvector can be treated as the ratio of the different stages of life of a species in the long term. Thus in this model the starting population follows this ratio, this is referred to as a pre breeding census[4].\n",
    "\n",
    "The species were modelled using a time-invariant Leslie matrix model assuming birth-pulse populations and a pre breeding census. The Age-based matrix models were designed according to the mathematical description by Douglas S. Vaughan of the National Marine Fisheries Service[21].\n",
    "\n",
    "The models and the rest of this investigation are done using Python 3 with the modules used being matplotlib, csv, numpy and pandas. Numpy is used for it's array class; it allows for easy matrix manipulation, numpy is also the module both pandas and matplotlib are built on. Matplotlib is used for plotting and Pandas is used because it makes manipulating large data sets simple and allows for more readability."

    "Applying matrix multiplication between the Leslie matrix and the population of a species will give the subsequent population as described in 2.3, by repeatedly applying the Leslie matrix for 20 iterations we can find how the population of that species at each stage of life changes over 20 years. We did this by using the numpy function matmul which does matrix multiplication over 20 iterations, everytime happening each value of the matrix that represents population to a list that corresponds to the age of the life form that value represents. These lists are stored as values in a dictionary with there keys being the one less the age of the beings. It's important that the key be one less than the age because that allows the iterator to be the key to the dictionary when it is a string using the str function and a integer when the int() function is used.\n",

From there we used the data frame to plot total capture quantity per year. Pandas uses plots its graphs using matplotlib, the benefit to using DataFrame.plot is that it allows to plot two columns of the dataframe against each other, this is also why using plt.show works."

    "### 2.3.12 Population vulnerability to fishing\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 70% of commercial fishing is done on adult fish for almost all species of fish[5]. If we make the assumption that all commercial fishing is done on adult fish we can estimate how vulnerable a species is to fishing; we can see how much the dominant eigenvalue changes as the adult mortality increases. We do this by finding the age for each species that they are considered adults, fish are considered adults when they can spawn offspring, so in our case when they have a fertility rate. Once a dictionary was made with the values being the age model species reach adulthood and the 3Alpha codes are the keys, we can iterate through a chosen range of values that will represent an increase in fishing, this will be added to the survival rates of the adults of a species and form a leslie matrix. The dominant eigenvalues of that leslie matrix as the adult survival rates change are then stored in a list, the maximum value from the list is subtracted from the minimum and those values are put into a dataframe and made readable with some pandas dataframe manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen range of values was np.logspace(-1,-0.05,25), as it varies though 0.1 to almost 0.9 and that represents a small part of the population that could be modeled as a single fishery to a large part of the population that could represent a whole industry. "

    "\n",
    "A time-variant leslie matrix (TVLM) unlike the time in-variant leslie matrix (TILM) changes as it is being used, after a subsequent years population is found with the TVLM one must calculate the new leslie matrix and multiply it with the found population to obtain the next population. One or more of the values of survival rate and/or fertility rate must change with time. In this case adult survival rate of northern pike changed with time, the years with higher amounts of total captured fish had lower survival rates of adult northern pike and vice versa. Adult survival rates were lowered due to the same reasoning discussed in 2.3.12. This was done in the same way as 2.3.12 however we calculate population in the same way as 2.3.7 rather than find the dominant eigenvalue."

Figure 1 to Figure 14 can be seen in 2.3.8, they show the populations of the model species at different ages under no fishing mortality however they do take into account mortality due to pollution. Figure 15 to Figure 28 can be seen in 2.3.11, they display the total capture quantity per year for each of the model species. Figure 29 to Figure 33 can be seen in 2.3.13 and shows Northern pike population against time as adult survival rate changes every year.\n",

    "### 3.3 Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 Tables in this investigation. Table 1 can be found in 2.3.9 and shows the Predicted hatchling mortality found using the method described by Douglas S. Vaughan and the Known Hatchling mortality for the 14 model species. Table 2 can be found in 2.3.10 and displays the quantity in tons that has been caught since 1950 and the rank in terms of total capture quantity since 1950 for the 14 model species. Table 3 can be found in 2.3.12 and presents the change in dominant eigenvalue as adult mortality varies, this can also be seen as resistance to changes in mortality rate due to fishing."

    "## 4 Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all the points of analysis in this investigation we will discuss 3; Table 1, Figure 29 to Figure 33 and European perch. In these discussions other figures, Tables and model species shall be used however the focus will be on those topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Table one is interesting because if it's results are wrong or have some level of error, the rest of my results and conclusions will be wrong; it's the crux of this investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the predicted hatch mortalies and the known hatch mortalities line up to be the same at one significant figures, this is important as the known hatch mortalities are precise to one significant figure, pandas makes all the values in a column have the same number of decimal places. There is no way of knowing if the predicted hatch mortality for the Ninespine stickleback is less accurate than Crucian carp, even though the percentage difference between Predicted hatch mortality and Known mortality is much larger for Ninespine stickleback being $12$% because both will be the known hatch mortality if rounded to one significant figure. It can be said that because the calculation (1) gave values that are correct to one significant figure, methods used in this investigation aren't wrong or at least not wrong for the model species and the data is consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that for all species $m_{1}$ wasn't calculated as we know none of the model species have a fertility rate at age zero, thus we know $m_{1}$ is zero\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 29 to Figure 33\n",
    "\n",
    "These figures are the most complex object in this investigation as they are non-linear. They also behave very strangely; unlike what would be suspected irrespective of the increase in mortality rate of adult Northern Pike the graphs all end up with very rapid exponential growth. Table 3 tells us that Northern Pike is one of the most vulnerable species to change in survivability rate of the adult population. However Figure 6 has the same shape as Figures 29 to Figure 33, Figure 6 is also just over 20 iterations whilst Figures 29 to Figure 33 have 67 iterations, it gets to this point of rapid exponential growth later than in Figure 6 which is probably the effect of the lower survival rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example displays that Table 3 isn't what it was designed to be and doesn't actually represent the vulnerability of species to change in fishing mortalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### European perch\n",
    "\n",
    "This species was a point of interest as it was the only one with a dominante eigenvalue with a value smaller than 1, this means that in the long term it shall expericence exponential decay as previously stated. It wouldn't make sense for naturaly occuing animals such as this one to experience exponential decay in population in the long term; it would be extinct by now. From Figure 1 we can see that if the dominante eigen value stays the way it is or at least where it is using this model, European perch will go extinct. From Table 2 we see that European perch is the second most farmed fish of all the model species and the graph in Figure 15 shows us that European perch farming has been increacing in capture rate consistently since 1950, this means a faster decay every year.

    "## Conclution\n",
    "\n",
    "Further reaserch could be done into European perch, what is impacting it's fertiliy and/or survival rates, wether that effect be natural or manmad and a solution to the problem. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species hasn't evaluated European perch since 2008[3] and perhaps in the time since then this problem arrose. It should be taken into account that this may have been an issue with the data being used and a deeper look into the data by a marine biolagist should be the first coese of action. Other work that could be done is methods for creating time-variant leslie matrix, by creating this more complex model one could more accuratly predict changes in not jsut marine life but terestrial as well.
